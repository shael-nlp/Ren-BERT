# Ren-BERT
An experimental video game project that utilises the BERT encoder architecture to process and understand user input.

The primary objective is to create a 'visual novel' style game that eliminates pre-made dialogue choices, instead allowing players to input their own dialogue, which the game understands and responds to appropriately.

FAQ:

1. Why?
- It would be incredibly fun to design an investigation game where players must think and type their own questions to ask suspects, rather than selecting from pre-made queries.

1. Encoder vs Decoder:
- Simply put, encoders are primarily designed for understanding text, while decoders are built for text generation. Since text generation is evidently more impressive, it has overshadowed encoders.

3. Wouldn't it be best to base a game on a decoder, allowing for engaging text generation?
- Decoders are far too resource-intensive to run efficiently on an average machine, and the most advanced models are closed source. Also, its not that good and breaks immersion pretty quickly.
